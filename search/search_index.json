When tags are merged or destroyed, it is not easily reversed. Currently, the goal when handling unsorted tags is consolidation. We are aiming to merge all closely related tags together while deleting any that are considered extraneous. The purpose is to create a curated set of tags that are as helpful and as consistent as possible, spanning every studio on StashDB. Just like with other parts of the database, merging is always preferred over deleting. Candidates for a merge/deletion could be tags that seem too vague, too specific, or otherwise irrelevant. These are of course subjective calls, but the rule of thumb should be, \"Does this tag have a unique and helpful meaning?\" If the answer is \"yes\", then keep it. If it's \"no\", then merging/deleting may be the best option. However, we are still trying to be conservative in our approach. Reverting changes can be tricky, so it's better to err on the side of keeping a tag if there's any doubt. Merges should also aim for a resulting tag that is consistent in its meaning. If the inclusion of a tag would result in less consistency of meaning, then it may be best to leave it separate for now. Finally, please remember to include any merged tag names as aliases.

The Tagger can be found on both the Scenes page and the Performers page by clicking on the double-label icon on the far right end of the toolbar near the top of the webpage.</p> <p>With the Scene Tagger, you can match your scenes with StashDB entries by keyword or fingerprint, save that information to your scene including a link to StashDB called the StashID, and submit your fingerprints back to StashDB to help other users match their own scenes. Be sure to check out the \"Scrape All\" button (limited to one page at a time), the green checkmarks to customize which fields to overwrite, and the gear icon for additional settings. If you've already found your scene's entry on StashDB, you can paste the StashID directly into the \"Query\" field to ensure an accurate match. New users may find our Guide to Scraping helpful, featuring a detailed step-by-step walkthrough with screenshots. Stash's in-app manual also has a shorter rundown of its features, found by clicking the \"?\" icon in the top right corner of Stash or at this link here.</p> <p>The Performer Tagger works similarly. Don't miss the \"Batch Add Performers\" and \"Batch Update Performers\" buttons on the top right, with a \"Show Configuration\" link on the opposite side.

Individual fields can be turned on and off for each scrape as well.</p> <p>The Identify task can also pull scene info from StashDB, but it is not recommended for new users at this time. This is considered an advanced feature of Stash and will be hidden behind the \"Advanced Mode\" toggle in the settings page. You can customize your settings beforehand, but Identify is a hands-off function unlike the Tagger views. There's no way to verify a match is correct before its info is saved locally. It is highly recommended to back up your database before running Identify in case you need to revert any unintended changes. Because of the lack of manual verification, it also does not submit your fingerprints to StashDB during this process. The Scene Tagger is still the only way to do that.</p> <p>Finally, if you have edit access, you can add/update scenes and performers to StashDB by submitting drafts directly from within Stash.

They are called \"drafts\" because they are not final. You will still have to navigate to the draft in StashDB to double-check the edit, make any needed adjustments, and leave a helpful comment before officially submitting it for approval. Until you click that \"Submit\" button, the draft is only visible to you. It is also temporary, each draft will expire after 24 hours.</p> <p>If you'd like to add a scene to StashDB, first make sure you have pHashes generated. It isn't turned on by default so make sure you've taken care of this already. Then, use the Scene Tagger or the StashDB scraper to find any pHash matches. Be careful when selecting your match because your scene may be a remaster, redistribution, or re-release. If your particular release isn't already on StashDB, you can add it yourself with a draft submission after your account is granted edit rights.</p> <p>From within a scene's details page, click on the three vertical dots in the top right of the details pane and select the \"Submit to Stash-Box\" option. Clicking the \"Submit\" button in the resulting dialog box will save a draft to create that scene on StashDB using the information you have saved locally. From the Drafts page, you can make any necessary changes, leave an edit comment, and finally submit your draft to be approved just like any other edit.</p> <p>If you've already matched your scene with an entry on StashDB and have the StashID saved locally, then you can submit a draft to update the scene instead. The process is mostly the same, using the same \"Submit to Stash-Box\" option except this time it will add or overwrite the info of StashDB's existing entry with the info you have saved locally. Make sure to review your draft first. If you don't want to replace the existing thumbnail just click the \"Reset Images\" button in the images tab to preserve the old one. Please note that draft updates will not add missing fingerprints, you will need to use the Scene Tagger for that instead.</p> <p>The same process can be used for creating and updating performers, just click the big blue \"Submit to Stash-Box\" button near the top of a performer's details page in Stash.</p>"},{"location":"moderation/enforcement/","title":"StashDB Moderation Enforcement","text":""},{"location":"moderation/enforcement/#overview","title":"Overview","text":"<p>At the discretion of one of StashDB\u2019s admins, a user\u2019s EDIT and VOTE roles may be revoked at any time.

Different sources will prefer different spellings. For StashDB, we prefer the Western order with Latin characters for all JAV performers as the primary name, matching the formatting of our non-JAV performers. This also makes things simpler for crossover performers who have worked in both Western and JAV productions. Names in the reverse order should always be included as aliases.</p> <p>To give an example, we use the name Marica Hase on StashDB. She has done many Western scenes after starting on the JAV side of things, but her primary name is the same regardless of whether she's considered a JAV performer or a Western performer: <code>Marica Hase</code>. Alternate spellings <code>Hase Marica</code> and <code>\u306f\u305b\u307e\u308a\u304b</code> are included as aliases. All three are the same name, just spelled three different ways following three different formats.</p> <p>The same guidelines for picking a primary name apply equally to JAV and Western performers. However, JAV performers may also have the same name spelled in various ways following various different conventions for using Latin characters. Typically, StashDB prefers the use of a simplified Hepburn romanization for primary names which avoids the use of double vowels like <code>oo</code> or <code>uu</code> as well as diacritic marks like <code>\u014d</code> or <code>\u016b</code>. This is also the same spelling preferred by X/s List which is one of the only remaining JAV databases in English. However, an exception may be allowed on a case-by-case basis if a particular romanization for their name that does not follow this convention is the most commonly used or is known to be the performer's preferred spelling. Again, these are the same guidelines for choosing alternate spellings of Western performer names and they still apply here as well. But due to the difficulty for non-Japanese speakers to determine this for all but the most popular Japanese performers, using the simplified Hepburn spelling as the default should cover most JAV performers without requiring additional research.</p> <p>As another example, we prefer the spelling of Yu Shinoda as the primary name instead of <code>Yuu Shinoda</code> or <code>Y\u016b Shinoda</code>. If we were creating this performer for the first time, this would be a safe first assumption because it avoids using double vowels or diacritic marks and matches the spelling used on X\\s List. If we really wanted to dig deeper (which isn't required for an initial creation and is only possible because she's a popular performer), we'd find different romaji spellings used on Minnano-AV, IMDB, Wikidata, and even her own Instagram. But since her agency, Twitter, IAFD, FreeOnes, and Babepedia all use <code>Yu Shinoda</code>, that remains the preferred option because it appears to be her own preferred romanization as well as the most commonly used spelling for English language databases. All other spellings that can be found should be used as aliases instead.</p>"},{"location":"performers/personal-information/name/#suspicious-names","title":"Suspicious Names","text":"<p>Exercise caution with odd looking names, particularly those listed on FreeOnes.</p> <p>Not all names and aliases listed on external sources are appropriate on StashDB.

Please see Eligible Aliases for more details on alias requirements.</p> <p>Users should be cautious when sourcing names and aliases from FreeOnes in particular. Because FreeOnes disallows single name performers, some contributors bypass the limitation by fabricating longer names for single name performers. These usually consist of two single name aliases merged into one. For example, a performer with the aliases <code>Lucy</code> and <code>Jane</code> could become <code>Lucy Jane</code> on FreeOnes. Since these names are not used anywhere else, they should not be included on StashDB.</p> <p>FreeOnes will often list suspected legal names of performers as well.
