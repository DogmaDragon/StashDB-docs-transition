# Animated Scene Covers

{: .important }
**Official static scene covers are preferred whenever possible, otherwise closest static equivalent is fine.**

---

Studios will occasionally use animated GIFs or WEBPs as an official scene cover or thumbnail. For example, BangBros does this with scenes like [this one (NSFW)](https://x-images2.bangbros.com/assparade/shoots/ap19185/members/450x340.jpg){:target="_blank"}. If the studio hosts a static scene cover as an alternative somewhere, then this should be used instead. Otherwise, use your best judgment to find the closest static equivalent to the official animated cover. This could be a different thumbnail, a preview image, a gallery image, a custom screenshot, or a conversion of the animated file. Please remember to note in your edit comment where you've found this alternative cover.
