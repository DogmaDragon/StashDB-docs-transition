# Preferred Scene Descriptions

{: .important }
**Original official descriptions are preferred.**

---

Original descriptions provided by the official studio website are always the preferred scene description. Descriptions that have been modified by the studio after its original release should not be used in the details field on StashDB. If the studio does not have a unique description for the scene, the details field should be left blank. Auto-generated placeholder descriptions provided by the studio (sometimes referred to as "boilerplate" descriptions) are not considered unique and should not be included. Descriptions provided by a source other than the official studio should also not be included.
