# Priority Sources for Scene Tags

{: .important }
**From highest to lowest: original video, official tube-site edits, trailers, screenshots, scraped tags, galleries, thumbnails, official descriptions, unofficial descriptions.**

---

The primary source for manually curating a scene's tags is the video itself. Other sources may be used as well, but the video supersedes any other conflicting sources. Order of authority for sources can be considered (from highest to lowest): the original video, official tube-site edits, trailers, screenshots, scraped tags, galleries, thumbnails, official descriptions, unofficial descriptions. Just be sure to mention in your edit comment what your source is and try not to overrule a source with a higher level of authority than yours.
