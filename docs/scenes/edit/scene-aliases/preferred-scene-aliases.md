# Preferred Scene Aliases

{: .important }
**Should be the name officially credited to the performer at the time of release.**

---

The scene alias can be entered into the field immediately to the right of the performer in the scene edit form. This should be used for whatever name was used as the performer's official credit at the time of release from the original source. It should not be used for character names unless it also serves as the performer's official credit.

To be clear, contributors aren't expected to consult the Wayback Machine to verify every single scene alias in their submissions. Whatever the studio link currently lists is usually a reliable default, but editors should try to use the correct name for this field when there's a discrepancy in the description, on the scene cover, in IAFD credits, etc.
