# Ambiguous Performers

{: .important }
**Must avoid ambiguous performer entries, creating new disambiguated entries when necessary.**

---

[Ambiguous performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/performers/ambiguous-performers/) should not be added to a scene entry. You should always try to find a properly disambiguated performer entry for your scene. If no entry exists yet for your performer, you will need to create one.

{: .note }
Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval.
