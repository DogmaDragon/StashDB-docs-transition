# Scene Details

Guidelines relating to a scene's written description are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For scene guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Preferred Scene Descriptions

{: .important }
**Original official descriptions are preferred.**

Original descriptions provided by the official studio website are always the preferred scene description. Descriptions that have been modified by the studio after its original release should not be used in the details field on StashDB. If the studio does not have a unique description for the scene, the details field should be left blank. Auto-generated placeholder descriptions provided by the studio (sometimes referred to as "boilerplate" descriptions) are not considered unique and should not be included. Descriptions provided by a source other than the official studio should also not be included.

## Correcting Scene Descriptions

{: .important }
**Descriptions should be unaltered from the original studio source in spelling, capitalization, grammar, and punctuation.**

Even when the studio description has obvious grammatical or typographical errors, it should be preserved as it originally appeared. This includes misspellings, incorrect punctuation, odd capitalization, etc. However, exceptions can be made for obvious technical errors introduced by a bad scrape or website update. This includes encoding errors on special characters, obvious glitches with whitespace, visible HTML tags instead of line breaks, etc.

## Preferred Description Language

{: .important }
**English description are preferred when provided by official website.**

Some studios offer multiple language options on their official website. In these situations, the English versions of scene titles and descriptions are preferred for StashDB. If there is no official English translation available, the next best option is the original language.
