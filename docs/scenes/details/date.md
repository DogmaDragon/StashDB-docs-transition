# Scene Date

Guidelines relating to a scene's release date are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For scene guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Preferred Scene Dates

{: .important }
**Earliest known release date, or closest approximate date.**

The earliest known release date for a scene is always the preferred scene date. Production dates should not be used for this field. For [remasters/redistributions/re-releases]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/create/re-releases/), the earliest release date refers to that particular release and not the original scene. Approximate dates may be accepted if no exact release date can be sourced or verified. Stash-Box will allow you to omit the day or month in these situations.

{: .note }
Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval.
