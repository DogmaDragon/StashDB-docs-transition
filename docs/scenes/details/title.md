# Scene Title

Guidelines relating to a scene's title are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For scene guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Preferred Scene Titles

{: .important }
**Original official scene titles are preferred.**

Original scene titles provided by the official studio website are always the preferred scene title. Scene titles that have been modified by the studio after its original release should not be used as the scene title on StashDB.

## Correcting Scene Titles

{: .important }
**Titles should be unaltered from the original studio source in spelling, capitalization, grammar, and punctuation.**

Even when the studio title has obvious grammatical or typographical errors, it should be preserved as it originally appeared. This includes misspellings, incorrect punctuation, odd capitalization, etc. However, exceptions can be made for obvious technical errors introduced by a bad scrape or website update. This includes encoding errors on special characters for example. Exceptions may also be made for scenes from a series/movie that do not specify a scene/episode number. Typically, we add this in the format `Title - Scene 1` but there is no officially required formatting for scene numbers at this time. We also do not alter the official studio's formatting when they do specify a scene in their title.

## Preferred Title Language

{: .important }
**English titles are preferred when provided by official website.**

Some studios offer multiple language options on their official website. In these situations, the English versions of scene titles and descriptions are preferred for StashDB. If there is no official English translation available, the next best option is the original language.
