# Scene Performers

Guidelines relating to a scene's performers are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For scene guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Missing Performers

{: .important }
**Must include performers listed anywhere on linked webpages, including descriptions.**

All active performers listed in the details, title, URL, or a linked webpage should be included when adding or editing a scene. This includes male performers in straight scenes. Please note in your edit comment why any performers are not included in your submission. Finding names for missing performers on recommended databases (IAFD, Data18, etc.) is greatly encouraged, but often not required.

{: .note }
Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval.

## Ambiguous Performers

{: .important }
**Must avoid ambiguous performer entries, creating new disambiguated entries when necessary.**

[Ambiguous performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/performers/ambiguous-performers/) should not be added to a scene entry. You should always try to find a properly disambiguated performer entry for your scene. If no entry exists yet for your performer, you will need to create one.

{: .note }
Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval.

## Preferred Scene Aliases

{: .important }
**Should be the name officially credited to the performer at the time of release.**

The scene alias can be entered into the field immediately to the right of the performer in the scene edit form. This should be used for whatever name was used as the performer's official credit at the time of release from the original source. It should not be used for character names unless it also serves as the performer's official credit.

To be clear, contributors aren't expected to consult the Wayback Machine to verify every single scene alias in their submissions. Whatever the studio link currently lists is usually a reliable default, but editors should try to use the correct name for this field when there's a discrepancy in the description, on the scene cover, in IAFD credits, etc.
