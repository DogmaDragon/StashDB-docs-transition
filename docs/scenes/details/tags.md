# Scene Tags

Guidelines relating to the tags attached to a scene are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For scene guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Priority Sources for Scene Tags

{: .important }
**From highest to lowest: original video, official tube-site edits, trailers, screenshots, scraped tags, galleries, thumbnails, official descriptions, unofficial descriptions.**

The primary source for manually curating a scene's tags is the video itself. Other sources may be used as well, but the video supersedes any other conflicting sources. Order of authority for sources can be considered (from highest to lowest): the original video, official tube-site edits, trailers, screenshots, scraped tags, galleries, thumbnails, official descriptions, unofficial descriptions. Just be sure to mention in your edit comment what your source is and try not to overrule a source with a higher level of authority than yours.

## Picking Scene Tags

{: .important }
**Start small with "important" tags first, expand as you get more familiar with StashDB's list.**

The list of tags on StashDB is long. You don't have to be aware of all of them. You don't have to add every tag that possibly fits. Think of tags as an additional way to describe a scene and focus on adding tags you think are important to describing the scene in front of you. That may require relatively few tags or it could require a lot. You may as well start small and slowly expand from there as you become more familiar with the tags available on StashDB. If you have any questions about how to use a particular tag, first read its description carefully. [Previous edit comments]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/tags/tag-edit-comments/) may give you more information as well. Otherwise, feel free to ask in the **#ministry-of-truth** channel on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-discord-and-matrix/). Also, please explain in your own edit comment [where your tags are coming from]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/edit/scene-tags/priority-tag-sources/), if they're simply scraped or if you've added/removed some yourself.
