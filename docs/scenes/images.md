# Scene Images

Guidelines relating to cover images attached to a scene are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For scene guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Animated Scene Covers

{: .important }
**Official static scene covers are preferred whenever possible, otherwise closest static equivalent is fine.**

Studios will occasionally use animated GIFs or WEBPs as an official scene cover or thumbnail. For example, BangBros does this with scenes like [this one (NSFW)](https://x-images2.bangbros.com/assparade/shoots/ap19185/members/450x340.jpg){:target="_blank"}. If the studio hosts a static scene cover as an alternative somewhere, then this should be used instead. Otherwise, use your best judgment to find the closest static equivalent to the official animated cover. This could be a different thumbnail, a preview image, a gallery image, a custom screenshot, or a conversion of the animated file. Please remember to note in your edit comment where you've found this alternative cover.
