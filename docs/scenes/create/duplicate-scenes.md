# Duplicate Scenes

{: .important }
**No exact duplicates, prefer to keep entries with more fingerprints.**

---

Exact duplicates should always be rejected or removed. Exceptions may be made for [remasters, rereleases, and redistributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/create/re-releases/) in some cases. When deleting duplicate scenes, our preference is to keep the entry with the higher number of unique fingerprints and/or fingerprint submissions.

Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval.
