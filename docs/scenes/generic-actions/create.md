# Creating Scenes

Guidelines unique to the creation of a new scene are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For performer guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Duplicate Scenes

{: .important }
**No exact duplicates, prefer to keep entries with more fingerprints.**

Exact duplicates should always be rejected or removed. Exceptions may be made for [remasters, rereleases, and redistributions]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/create/re-releases/) in some cases. When deleting duplicate scenes, our preference is to keep the entry with the higher number of unique fingerprints and/or fingerprint submissions.

## Remasters, Redistributions, and Re-Releases

{: .important }
**Distinct remasters/redistributions/re-releases are allowed with unique studio links, but cross-posted amateur releases only need one entry.**

Remasters (higher quality release of an old scene by the same network/studio), redistributions (cross-network releases), and re-releases (same network releases again) are allowed when they have a unique scene entry and URL on a studio website. The [preferred scene date]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/edit/scene-date/preferred-scene-dates/) is the release date of that particular release, not the original's release date. Production dates should not be used for this field either. If a studio changes the release date displayed on their website to make an old scene appear newer, this is not considered a re-release requiring a separate scene entry. All relevant fields including title, description, thumbnail, and scene alias should be sourced from that particular release and not from other releases. Also, please attach a [Remaster](https://stashdb.org/tags/faf494d6-9092-4dd5-86d7-0978c596b547){:target="_blank"}, [Redistribution](https://stashdb.org/tags/1a3906db-b644-41e3-9fe3-d0a26abb0930){:target="_blank"}, or [Re-release](https://stashdb.org/tags/8ffe05b5-9a21-4dba-a94c-c1e441790ece){:target="_blank"} tag when appropriate.

Note that the above only applies to a "studio website." Self-produced content is often released on multiple [amateur platforms]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/create/amateur-studios/) but each release does not require a separate entry on StashDB. Amateur scenes are organized by creator not by platform and scenes are the same way. Use the oldest known release date and whatever the "best" source appears to be for other fields like title, description, thumbnail, etc. There is no specific guidance on what is considered the "best" at this time, so just rely on your own judgment.

## PornHub Scenes

{: .important }
**Must be original scenes made and uploaded by verified creators.**

Scenes from PornHub must be original content uploaded by verified creators. Scenes uploaded by a third party are not allowed. Trailers and abridged scenes from major studios are not allowed. Fan-created content like compilations or PMVs are not allowed. Adding scenes with simply "PornHub" as the studio is not allowed. Scenes must use a [sub-studio for the content creator]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/create/amateur-studios/) instead.

## Full Movie Entries

{: .important }
**Full movies only allowed for JAV releases or western releases available directly from official studio websites.**

Scene entries that represent full movies are only accepted in limited circumstances. Full movies must have an official studio website as its source that provides downloads of the full movie as a single file. Submissions that only have 3rd party retailers (Adult DVD Empire, Hot Movies, etc.) or databases (IAFD, Data18, etc.) as their source may not be accepted. JAV movies have been granted an exception for now since they come almost exclusively as full movie downloads instead of split scenes. We still ask that you hold off until further software developments can be made to better support movies in StashDB.

## Split Movie Scenes

{: .important }
**Scenes split from movies are only allowed when offered by the studio's 1st party website, not 3rd party storefronts.**

Split scenes are expected to have a first party digital source as its primary source of info. Basically, this means a scene from `Studio X` should be sourced from `StudioX.com`. All info (release date, title, description, scene aliases, etc.) should match the first party digital release when possible. If the scene did not have a first party digital release, then it is not eligible on StashDB at this time. We are waiting for further developments regarding movies and release groups on Stash-Box before including physical releases (VHS, DVD, etc.) and third party retailers ([Adult Empire](https://www.adultdvdempire.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Hot Movies](https://www.hotmovies.com/){:target="_blank"}, etc.) on StashDB.

If a split scene is no longer available from the studio's website or if the studio's website no longer exists, it can still be added to StashDB. An archived page (from the [Wayback Machine](https://web.archive.org/){:target="_blank"}, for example) is almost always the best primary source for info. A link to an archive of the scene's page may be used as the studio link as well, but if your source is an archive of a different page (home page, tour page, performer profile, list of scenes, etc.) then it should only be used in your edit comment. If no archived page can be found, info may be sourced from third party databases ([IAFD](https://www.iafd.com/){:target="_blank"}, [Data18](https://www.data18.com/){:target="_blank"}, etc.) instead. Also, don't forget to include the `Missing or Removed` tag for unavailable scenes.

Third party storefronts are not acceptable as a studio link. These URLs may be included in the edit comment if they were used as a supplemental source of info.
