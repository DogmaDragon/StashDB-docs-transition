# Studio Images

Guidelines relating to images attached to a studio's profile are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For studio guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Seasonal Logos

{: .important }
**Temporary seasonal logos should not be used when a more permanent variation is available.**

Occasionally, studio websites will temporarily change their logo for a particular event or cause. Examples include Halloween, Pride Month, some kind of awareness/fundraising campaign, etc. These temporary logos should not be used as the primary logo on StashDB when a more recent and permanent variation is available. If a non-seasonal image cannot be found on the current studio website, the Wayback Machine and any other external sources should be checked first before using the seasonal variation as a placeholder.
