# Animated Studios

{: .important }
**Only allowed from professional studios, not independent content creators.**

---

Animated content is currently allowed on StashDB only in limited circumstances. Animated scenes are only allowed from what can be considered professional studios and not independent content creators. This means they will need a stand-alone website or belong to a larger network. Creators selling animated content through an online marketplace or a subscription service like Patreon are not allowed at this time. The reasoning for this is due to a desire to move slowly with this content, so it may change in the future. A small number of scenes and studios were added prior to this policy's implementation and do not need to be removed at this time, but new scenes and studios will likely be rejected.

Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval.
