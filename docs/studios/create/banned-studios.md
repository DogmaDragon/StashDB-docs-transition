# Banned Studios

{: .important }
**No studios that repeatedly violate the consent of performers, including "Girls Do Porn" and its spin-off "Girls Do Toys".**

---

Currently, the only studios explicitly banned from StashDB for content alone are Girls Do Porn and their spin-off Girls Do Toys. This is due to the [repeated violations of their performers' consent and the resulting legal ramifications](https://www.xbiz.com/news/247515/heres-what-you-need-to-know-about-the-girlsdoporn-case){:target="_blank"}.

While not listed individually here, other scenes and studios that are known to violate the consent of their performers are not allowed anywhere on StashDB and will be rejected or removed. Any scenes or images that are known to include underage performers will also be rejected or removed.
