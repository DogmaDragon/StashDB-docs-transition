## Updating Edits

{: .important }
**You can update your own pending edit exactly once, otherwise you may need to cancel and resubmit.**

You can update your own pending edits once and only once. The button is kind of hidden. You first have to navigate to the page for that individual submission by clicking the heading in the top left of the edit card. It should say something like "Create Scene" or "Modify Performer". You should then see a blue "Update Edit" button at the bottom of the page. You'll then see the edit form in the same state as the current submission. Just remember to leave an additional [edit comment]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/edit-comments/) explaining your new adjustments before clicking "Submit Edit" again. Remember, you can only update each edit exactly once so try not to miss anything. It saves us all the extra time and effort of making additional corrections.

At this time, updating your edit does not reset previously cast votes. This means any "No" votes cast before the update will remain until a "No" voter comes back to change it. The edit's individual page (click the heading) will also show who's voted "Yes" and "No" already. Many users will check back on an edit after downvoting it to see if their requested changes have been made, but you may also contact them [on Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-discord-and-matrix/) yourself if you're worried about rejection or a long wait time. Their username in StashDB isn't always the same on Discord but a quick search in **#stashdb-invites** should find their request for edit access. Just be polite and respectful while asking them to flip their vote.

If you've already used your one update and still need to change something before your submission can be approved, unfortunately you'll need to [cancel]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/cancelling-edits/) and resubmit it. First click the red "Cancel Edit" button at the bottom of the edit's page. It'll be right next to the blue "Update Edit" button. There is no way to revive a cancelled edit so you'll need start from the beginning again to recreate it.

Also, please be aware that abusing the edit system in any way could result in the [removal of edit access]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/moderation-enforcement/#abuse-of-the-edit-system-1). This includes using the update system in an attempt to circumvent the typical voting process.

## Cancelling Edits

{: .important }
**You may cancel your own pending edit, but be careful because it cannot be undone.**

Sometimes you may want to cancel your own pending edit. Perhaps you've already used your [one update]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/updating-edits/) and realize it still needs more work. Maybe it's collected several NO votes and you just don't want an additional rejection on your [User]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/user/) page.

The button to cancel your edit is a little hidden. You first have to navigate to the page for that individual submission by clicking the heading in the top left of the edit card. It should say something like "Create Scene" or "Modify Performer". You should then see a red "Cancel Edit" button at the bottom of the page. It'll be right next to the blue "Update Edit" button.

Take care when cancelling your edit because it cannot be undone. If you wish to revive a cancelled edit, you'll need to start from the beginning to recreate it from scratch.

## Voting on StashDB

{: .important }
**Different voting thresholds apply to destructive vs. non-destructive edits. Voting rights granted automatically after 10 approved submissions.**

All edit submissions to StashDB will be subject to approval by the votes of other contributors. Voting rights will be granted automatically once you have 10 submissions approved.

Edits considered ***non-destructive*** may be approved immediately if they receive three unanimous YES votes. They may also be rejected immediately with three unanimous NO votes. Waiting periods are only required when there are less than 3 votes or when the vote is non-unanimous. This may be 3 days or 7 days, depending on the current vote total. Net totals of 0 votes will be ***approved*** at the end of the waiting period for non-destructive edits.

***Destructive edits*** (Merge and Destroy requests, mostly) always require a minimum waiting period to pass before it is approved or rejected. This may be 3 days or 7 days, depending on the current vote total. Net totals of 0 votes will be ***rejected*** for destructive edits.

For more details on a particular edit, let your cursor hover over "Voting closes in X days" in the top right corner of the edit card. It will show you — based on the current vote total — the exact day and time the voting period will end and if it will be rejected or approved.

The ABSTAIN option is only used if you would like to remove your YES or NO vote instead of changing it. The "Save" button will not appear when ABSTAIN is selected unless you have previously saved a YES or NO vote on that edit.

[Asking for votes on Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/asking-for-votes/) in order to speed up the approval process is only recommended in specific situations.

Also, please be aware that abusing the voting system in any way could result in the [removal of editing and voting privileges]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/moderation-enforcement/#abuse-of-the-voting-system-1).

## Asking for Votes

{: .important }
**Asking on Discord is discouraged unless the edit needs to be approved before additional edits can be submitted.**

Typically, asking on Discord for votes to approve your own edit is seen as impolite. Many see it as similar to jumping to the front of the line instead of waiting your turn. There are exceptions to this though. Often edits act as "blockers" to other edits. Maybe someone has a scene they want to add to StashDB, but they need a performer or studio to be approved first before they can be attached to the scene submission. The performer/studio submission is considered a "blocker" to the scene submission, so it would be appropriate to ask in the **#stashdb-general** channel on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-discord-and-matrix/) to expedite its approval. In cases like these, longer approval times actually do inconvenience the contributor where waiting on typical edits would not.

## Edit Comments

{: .important }
**Say what you're doing, why you're doing it, and what your sources are.**

Regardless of what kind of edit you're submitting, always include in the comment field what you are doing and why. Bigger or more drastic changes will likely require longer comments, but simple changes likely won't need much. Also please remember to note what you are using as the source of your edit when appropriate. These notes will be helpful when considering further edits in addition to justifying your actions now to those who will be voting on it.

Also, please be aware that abusing the comment system in any way could result in the [removal of edit access]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/moderation-enforcement/#abuse-of-the-comment-system-1). Click the hyperlink for examples of what may be considered abuse of the system.

## Low Effort Submissions

{: .important }
**Submissions may be rejected as "low effort" if it will take more time/effort to fix than it would've taken the OP to do correctly in the first place.**

Submissions of any kind may be rejected if voters deem them to be "low effort" even if it doesn't technically violate any other guidelines and all of its information is correct. "Low effort" submissions appear rushed and often leave out information that is obvious or easily found. The reasoning behind rejection is that "low effort" submissions will take the same amount of time and effort for others to fix (if not more) as it would have taken the original contributor to make a complete submission in the first place. It will also often be faster and easier for the original contributor to update or cancel/redo their own submission than for somebody else to do it for them.

"Low effort" submissions should not be confused with small edits, which are of course welcome on StashDB. If you fear that your edit may appear incomplete to others and could be at risk of downvotes as a "low effort" submission, make sure you explain why your edit may look that way (performer not listed anywhere, couldn't find any details/photos for a performer, waiting for another edit to be approved before you can add something, etc.) Voters won't be inclined to downvote if you acknowledge and explain a sparse edit. Also, please see our related policy on [missing scene performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/edit/scene-performers/missing-performers/).

If a user continually makes "low effort" submissions, their actions could be considered repeated violations of the guidelines and may result in the [removal of edit access]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/moderation-enforcement/#repeated-violations-of-the-guidelines-1).

## Bulk Edits

{: .important }
**Big projects that require a large number of edits should be pitched on Discord first for approval.**

Any projects that would affect a large amount of data on StashDB and/or require a high volume of individual edits will need to be approved on Discord first by dropping a question in the **#stashdb-general** channel. If it's in line with the guidelines already established on this website, then a simple "heads up" before starting may be all that is needed from you. More drastic changes may require formal approval as a [guideline proposal]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/guideline-proposals/) in the **#stashdb-guidelines** channel on Discord. Projects that would add more than a few dozen edits into the queue at a time may need to be broken up into smaller chunks.

All of the points mentioned above apply to both manual submissions and automated submissions. However, automated submissions are only allowed with permission from an admin. This requires a special BOT role in your account before edits can be flagged as automated within the edit queue.

Violating any of these requirements could result in the [loss of edit access]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/moderation-enforcement/#abuse-of-the-edit-system-1).
