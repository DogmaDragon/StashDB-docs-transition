# Asking for Votes

{: .important }
**Asking on Discord is discouraged unless the edit needs to be approved before additional edits can be submitted.**

---

Typically, asking on Discord for votes to approve your own edit is seen as impolite. Many see it as similar to jumping to the front of the line instead of waiting your turn. There are exceptions to this though. Often edits act as "blockers" to other edits. Maybe someone has a scene they want to add to StashDB, but they need a performer or studio to be approved first before they can be attached to the scene submission. The performer/studio submission is considered a "blocker" to the scene submission, so it would be appropriate to ask in the **#stashdb-general** channel on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-discord-and-matrix/) to expedite its approval. In cases like these, longer approval times actually do inconvenience the contributor where waiting on typical edits would not.
