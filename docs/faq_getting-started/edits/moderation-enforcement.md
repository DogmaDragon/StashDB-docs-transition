# StashDB Moderation Enforcement

## Overview

At the discretion of one of StashDB’s admins, a user’s EDIT and VOTE roles may be revoked ***at any time***. However, know that we have rarely felt the need to take this course of action. Every situation is unique and we strive to only take action ***when absolutely necessary***.

In short, we ask all contributors to act conscientiously with the best interests of the community in mind. We will exercise our authority and restraint to maintain the integrity of both the database and the community as we see fit.

**The following behavior may be grounds for the loss of editing or voting rights:**

1. ### [Abuse of the edit system](#abuse-of-the-edit-system-1)
2. ### [Abuse of the voting system](#abuse-of-the-voting-system-1)
3. ### [Abuse of the comment system](#abuse-of-the-comment-system-1)
4. ### [Repeated violations of the guidelines](#repeated-violations-of-the-guidelines-1)
5. ### [Technical hacks or exploits](#technical-hacks-or-exploits-1)
6. ### [Any other misconduct considered serious enough to warrant action](#any-other-misconduct-considered-serious-enough-to-warrant-action-1)

## Warnings and Restorations

An admin will almost always attempt to warn a user first when their actions could lead to the loss of their EDIT and VOTE roles. If the warning goes ***ignored or unseen***, continued violations will result in disciplinary action.

However, an admin may also decide to revoke these privileges ***without warning*** in order to prevent further violations. This decision is most often made to limit the damage of a user in the middle of a run of violations who is not immediately responding to requests to stop.

A user’s EDIT and VOTE roles may be restored ***exactly one time***, but only if an admin considers it appropriate to the situation. If these privileges are revoked a second time, ***it will be permanent***. We are a small team who are unable to spend an extended period of time dealing with multiple violations/appeals from a single account. ***All decisions are final***.

{: .note }
The most common reason for losing these privileges is a ***lack of communication***. If we cannot reach you through edit comments or messages on Discord/Matrix to correct continued violations of the guidelines, revoking edit access becomes our last resort to get in touch with you. We understand that tracking edit comments on StashDB can be difficult at this time. That is why we stress to all editors the importance of ***being reachable on Discord/Matrix***.
