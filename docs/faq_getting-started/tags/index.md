### [Check Tag Usage](check-tag-usage)

{: .important }
**Look at the scenes underneath a tag to get an idea of its current usage before submitting a destructive edit or description change.** *[See more...](check-tag-usage)*


### [Scraped vs. Manual Tags](scraped-vs-manual-tags)

{: .important }
**Most tags attached to scenes were scraped from studio sources, not manually added by editors.** *[See more...](scraped-vs-manual-tags)*


### [Sorted vs. Unsorted Tags](sorted-vs-unsorted-tags)

{: .important }
**Tags without categories and/or descriptions are considered "unsorted" and should generally be avoided when manually adding tags to scenes.** *[See more...](sorted-vs-unsorted-tags)*


### [Merging and Destroying Tags](merging-and-destroying-tags)

{: .important }
**Unsorted tags that do not have a unique and helpful meaning are candidates for merging/deleting.** *[See more...](merging-and-destroying-tags)*


### [Tag Edit Comments](tag-edit-comments)

{: .important }
