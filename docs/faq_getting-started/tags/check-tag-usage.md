# Check Tag Usage

{: .important }
**Look at the scenes underneath a tag to get an idea of its current usage before submitting a destructive edit or description change.**

---

Before submitting an edit to a tag, always look through the scenes underneath it first. Most tags are defined to [match their current usage]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/tags/scraped-vs-manual-tags/), so you will need to have a good idea of how it's currently used before you can make an informed decision about how it should be handled. If you're trying to write a new definition for a tag that's missing one, you may find that its scenes are using that tag differently than what you assumed. A tag's current usage, the consistency of its usage, the source of its scenes, and its total number of scene entries will all factor into decisions regarding possible edits.
