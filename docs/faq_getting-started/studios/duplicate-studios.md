**Search using keywords on "Studios" page.**

Before adding a new studio, make sure it doesn't already exist by searching [StashDB's list of studios](https://stashdb.org/studios){:target="_blank"}. Additional search terms will expand the list of results on that page right now, so try to limit yourself to the most unique search term in your studio's name. Also, be aware of our other policies for [creating studios]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/create/) that may be relevant.
