# Check Performers

{: .important }
**Find missing performers and avoid ambiguous entries.**

---

When submitting a new scene, make sure that you are not [missing any performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/edit/scene-performers/missing-performers/). If they are listed on the studio page, in the title, or in the description, you will be expected to include them in your submission. Also make sure that none of your included performers link to [ambiguous performer entries]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/performers/ambiguous-performers/). These are most often single-name performers with nothing in their disambiguation field. Both of these may put your scene creation at risk of being rejected.
