# Unconfirmed Guidelines

{: .important }
**Still expected to be followed but subject to change pending formal approval.**

---

Early on, many of this website's sections will have this message at the bottom:

{: .note }
Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval.

This just means the language has not been formally approved by the community in our **#stashdb-guidelines** channel on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-discord-and-matrix/) yet. Each one represents a working consensus developed organically between contributors over time.

Contributors are still expected to follow these unconfirmed guidelines, but should know that they are subject to change in the near future. Continually violating them may still result in the [removal of edit access]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/edits/moderation-enforcement/).
