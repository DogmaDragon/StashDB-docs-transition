# Guideline Proposals

{: .important }
**Changes to guidelines require formal approval, so ask about it on Discord first.**

---

If you would like to make a change or addition to the guidelines in this website, please ask about your idea in our **#ministry-of-truth** channel on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-discord-and-matrix/) first. If your suggestion gains traction there, a formal proposal will need to be approved by the community in the **#stashdb-guidelines** channel. Only users with elevated Discord roles will be able to post proposals there.
