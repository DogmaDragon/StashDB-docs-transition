# Image Sort Order

{: .important }
**Ranked by size (biggest to smallest), with any horizontal (landscape) images at the end.**

---

Images are currently ranked by size. This means the vertical image (portrait orientation) with the largest resolution is shown first, with the rest in descending order. Any horizontal images (landscape orientation) come last, also descending in size. Knowing this, it should be easier to find and recognize images that do not meet our minimum requirements.
