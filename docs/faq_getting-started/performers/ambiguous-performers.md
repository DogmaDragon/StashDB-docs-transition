# Ambiguous Performers

{: .important }
**Currently, only way is to reassign scenes to disambiguated performers individually.**

---

Many performer entries are considered "ambiguous", with multiple performers sharing the same entry on StashDB. This happens most often with single names with no last name or initial, for example "Anna" or "Tony". Currently, the only way to handle these is to reassign the performer on every scene individually which can be tedious and time-consuming. This also often requires the creation of multiple performer entries that do not exist separately yet, which slows down the process even more. There are plans to split these problem entries into multiple performers by studio/network to speed up the process with simple merges. This method is not possible yet.
