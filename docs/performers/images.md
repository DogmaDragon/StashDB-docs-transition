# Performer Images

Guidelines relating to images attached to a performer's profile are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For performer guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Performer Aspect Ratio

{: .important }
**2:3 ratio is preferred for vertical (portrait) images.**

Our preferred aspect ratio for vertical images (portrait orientation) is 2:3. For example, a resolution of 800x1200 has a 2:3 ratio. Some images may need to be cropped with a user's choice of image editing software to achieve this ratio. There is no hard requirement for enforcing this ratio at this time.

## Performer Image Size

{: .important }
**Images greater than 1280px will be automatically downscaled, "low quality" images may be rejected or removed.**

The maximum size for images in the Stash-Box software is 1280 pixels. Anything larger than that in either dimension will be downscaled automatically to that size. Images may be removed as "low quality" if they are considered too small or blurry if better alternative images are available for the performer. However, no specific minimum resolution has been agreed upon at this time.

## Performer Placeholder Images

{: .important }
**Anonymous placeholder images should be rejected or removed.**

Studios will often use anonymous placeholder images when they don't have anything else for a performer. These placeholder images should not be added to StashDB and any existing placeholders should be removed, even if they are the only images available for a performer. When imported into Stash, they can trick filters into thinking a performer has an image attached even though that image is functionally useless.

## Performer Watermarks / Logos

{: .important }
**It is recommended to edit watermarks or logos out of performer images if possible, but not required.**

There is no hard rule regarding watermarks and logos in performer images, but it is still recommended to avoid them if possible. Sometimes, these images can be cropped to remove unwanted watermarks or logos with your choice of image editing software. Some programs will allow you to "heal" the logo to remove it without cropping. If the logo is unobtrusive, "healing" it would create an odd smear, or removing it entirely would result in an awkward crop, then it may be better to leave it as-is.

## Multiple Performer Images

{: .important }
**Images with multiple performers should be cropped if possible, rejected or removed if better images are available.**

Images that contain multiple people should be removed as "low quality" if better alternative images are available for the performer. Sometimes, these images can be cropped to remove unwanted subjects with your choice of image editing software.

## Hardcore Performer Images

{: .important }
**Images with explicit sex acts should be cropped if possible, rejected or removed if better images are available.**

Images that contain explicit sex acts should be removed as "low quality" if better alternative images are available for the performer. Sometimes, these images can be cropped to remove hardcore content with your choice of image editing software.

{: .note }
Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval.

## BDSM Performer Images

{: .important }
**Images showing extreme BDSM practices should be cropped if possible, rejected or removed if better images are available.**

Images that contain explicit or extreme BDSM practices should be removed as "low quality" if better alternative images are available for the performer. Images could qualify for removal if they show severe contortions or possible injury to the body. Sometimes, these images can be cropped to remove explicit content with your choice of image editing software.

## Animated Performer Images

{: .important }
**Performer images must be static, animated images are not allowed at this time.**

Animated GIFs or WEBPs are not allowed as performer images at this time. These animated images are likely a niche preference and these files often take up a lot of space. For these reasons and for the sake of consistency on StashDB, we ask that you hold off on adding them for now.

There is a strong desire to add some form of [performer image categorization](https://github.com/stashapp/stash-box/issues/237){:target="_blank"} to Stash-Box in the future. The ability to properly flag and filter animated images would likely allow us to remove this restriction, but unfortunately we cannot say how long it will take to add this feature to StashDB.

## Performer Image Selection

{: .important }
**Variety is encouraged, allowing for different user preferences and easier identification from throughout a performer's career.**

A variety of performer images is welcomed and encouraged. This includes different "looks" from throughout a performer's career as well as various crops and poses. Different hair styles and colors, different body types or ages, with clothes or without clothes, close-up headshots or full body portraits, facing towards the camera or facing away, etc. Images that include distinctive features like tattoos may help with easier identification as well. More options on StashDB means a greater likelihood that users can find an appropriate image for importing into Stash or for identifying performers. Just be sure that any images you add don't violate any of the [separate requirements listed here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-images/).
