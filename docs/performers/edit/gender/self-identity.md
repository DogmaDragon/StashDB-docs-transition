# Performer Self-Identity

{: .important }
**In the case a performer's self-identity doesn't match how they present professionally, prefer their self-identity.**

---

When a performer's gender identity differs from their professional designation, preference is given to their self-identity.

One example would be a professionally designated female performer self-identifying as non-binary. In this case, non-binary would be the preferred designation for this performer.
