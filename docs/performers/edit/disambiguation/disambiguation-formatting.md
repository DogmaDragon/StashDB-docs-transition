# Disambiguation Formatting

{: .important }
**No standardized format, but a combination of career dates and some unique characteristic should work for most performers.**

---

While there is no standardized format at this time, most disambiguations share the same approach: a combination of career span and some unique characteristic. Remember, disambiguations are used to differentiate between performers that share the same name so make sure that your chosen characteristic uniquely identifies this performer compared to others who share their name. For example, `2008-2010, UK` if there's a difference in nationality or `BangBros, 2017` if they're exclusive to a particular network or studio. The exact order of `Years, Characteristic` vs. `Characteristic, Years` does not matter at this time.

Also, please note that there are no parentheses or brackets in the examples above. You only need to enter `1998-1999, Blonde` into the disambiguation field and it will be displayed as `Jane Doe (1998-1999, Blonde)` throughout StashDB. We want it to be as brief and clean as possible and do not want it to become `Jane Doe ((1998-1999, Blonde))`.
