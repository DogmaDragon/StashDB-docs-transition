# Multiple Performer Images

{: .important }
**Images with multiple performers should be cropped if possible, rejected or removed if better images are available.**

---

Images that contain multiple people should be removed as "low quality" if better alternative images are available for the performer. Sometimes, these images can be cropped to remove unwanted subjects with your choice of image editing software.
