# Performer Watermarks / Logos

{: .important }
**It is recommended to edit watermarks or logos out of performer images if possible, but not required.**

---

There is no hard rule regarding watermarks and logos in performer images, but it is still recommended to avoid them if possible. Sometimes, these images can be cropped to remove unwanted watermarks or logos with your choice of image editing software. Some programs will allow you to "heal" the logo to remove it without cropping. If the logo is unobtrusive, "healing" it would create an odd smear, or removing it entirely would result in an awkward crop, then it may be better to leave it as-is.
