# Performer Placeholder Images

{: .important }
**Anonymous placeholder images should be rejected or removed.**

---

Studios will often use anonymous placeholder images when they don't have anything else for a performer. These placeholder images should not be added to StashDB and any existing placeholders should be removed, even if they are the only images available for a performer. When imported into Stash, they can trick filters into thinking a performer has an image attached even though that image is functionally useless.
