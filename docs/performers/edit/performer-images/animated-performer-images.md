# Animated Performer Images

{: .important }
**Performer images must be static, animated images are not allowed at this time.**

---

Animated GIFs or WEBPs are not allowed as performer images at this time. These animated images are likely a niche preference and these files often take up a lot of space. For these reasons and for the sake of consistency on StashDB, we ask that you hold off on adding them for now.

There is a strong desire to add some form of [performer image categorization](https://github.com/stashapp/stash-box/issues/237){:target="_blank"} to Stash-Box in the future. The ability to properly flag and filter animated images would likely allow us to remove this restriction, but unfortunately we cannot say how long it will take to add this feature to StashDB.
