# Performer Image Selection

{: .important }
**Variety is encouraged, allowing for different user preferences and easier identification from throughout a performer's career.**

---

A variety of performer images is welcomed and encouraged. This includes different "looks" from throughout a performer's career as well as various crops and poses. Different hair styles and colors, different body types or ages, with clothes or without clothes, close-up headshots or full body portraits, facing towards the camera or facing away, etc. Images that include distinctive features like tattoos may help with easier identification as well. More options on StashDB means a greater likelihood that users can find an appropriate image for importing into Stash or for identifying performers. Just be sure that any images you add don't violate any of the [separate requirements listed here]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-images/).
