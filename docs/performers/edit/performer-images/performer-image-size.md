# Performer Image Size

{: .important }
**Images greater than 1280px will be automatically downscaled, "low quality" images may be rejected or removed.**

---

The maximum size for images in the Stash-Box software is 1280 pixels. Anything larger than that in either dimension will be downscaled automatically to that size. Images may be removed as "low quality" if they are considered too small or blurry if better alternative images are available for the performer. However, no specific minimum resolution has been agreed upon at this time.
