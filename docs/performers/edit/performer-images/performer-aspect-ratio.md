# Performer Aspect Ratio

{: .important }
**2:3 ratio is preferred for vertical (portrait) images.**

---

Our preferred aspect ratio for vertical images (portrait orientation) is 2:3. For example, a resolution of 800x1200 has a 2:3 ratio. Some images may need to be cropped with a user's choice of image editing software to achieve this ratio. There is no hard requirement for enforcing this ratio at this time.
