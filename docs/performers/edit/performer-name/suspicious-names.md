# Suspicious Names

{: .important }
**Exercise caution with odd looking names, particularly those listed on FreeOnes.**

---

Not all names and aliases listed on external sources are appropriate on StashDB. Names must have been used as an official adult credit somewhere to be eligible as a primary name or alias on StashDB. This disallows legal names in almost all instances. Please see [Eligible Aliases]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-aliases/eligible-aliases/) for more details on alias requirements.

Users should be cautious when sourcing names and aliases from FreeOnes in particular. Because FreeOnes disallows single name performers, some contributors bypass the limitation by fabricating longer names for single name performers. These usually consist of two single name aliases merged into one. For example, a performer with the aliases `Lucy` and `Jane` could become `Lucy Jane` on FreeOnes. Since these names are not used anywhere else, they should not be included on StashDB.

FreeOnes will often list suspected legal names of performers as well. They are not always accurate and they are not always used publicly by the performer. These names are usually very different from the performer's other listed aliases and from typical adult performer names in general, especially when they include middle names. Other sources will sometimes list suspected legal names as well, but they will often label them as "birthnames" or "real names."

Be skeptical of any name that isn't listed anywhere else, especially if it's a combination of other aliases or if it doesn't seem like a typical adult stage name.
