# Preferred Names

{: .important }
**Prefer unique names over commonly used aliases, but otherwise no hard rules only suggestions.**

---

There are no hard guidelines for choosing primary performer names at this time. However, more unique aliases are almost always preferred over common single word names like "Lola" or "Tony". If you must use a single name, make sure you add a [Disambiguation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/disambiguation/).

The following should also be taken into consideration: most frequently used alias, most famous/popular alias, most commonly used name on other databases like IAFD, and alias currently/recently preferred by the performer (often determined by social media profiles).

Also be aware that names are only eligible to be primary names if they've been used as an official adult credit, following the same requirements as [Eligible Aliases]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-aliases/eligible-aliases/).
