# Creating Performers

Guidelines unique to the creation of a new performer are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For performer guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Performer Eligibility

!!! abstract ""

    Must work with professional studios or have a verified account on at least one adult platform.

Our main concern here is with legality. StashDB cannot properly vet and verify performer ages by ourselves. We also can't verify whether performers are consenting to images/videos of themselves being shared. So, we have to rely on others to do this for us. This can be determined **two** different ways, detailed below. Any performers that do not meet one of these two criteria should be rejected or removed. But first, it's worth emphasizing...

!!! danger

    Any images or scenes that are known to feature underage performers will never be allowed on StashDB.

    No exceptions.

1. A performer is eligible if they have ever performed for a professional studio that hasn't been [banned from StashDB for repeated violations of age or consent]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/create/banned-studios). This means any performer from Brazzers, Adult Time, Vixen, Team Skeet, ExCoGi, NVG, etc. is allowed. This also includes classic performers whose careers predate digital distribution. It does not matter if all of their scenes are [currently ineligible for inclusion on StashDB]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/scenes/create/full-dvd-entries).

2. Amateur and semi-professional performers will need to include at least one verified profile from an adult platform. This includes Pornhub, ManyVids, and OnlyFans. Any other platforms that do not verify the ages and identities of their creators (TikTok, Reddit, Twitter, etc.) are not enough to make a performer eligible for StashDB. Please remember that even if a performer is allowed on StashDB, only scenes from [certain amateur platforms will be allowed]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/studios/create/amateur-studios). For example, performers who have only released content through OnlyFans will not have any scenes eligible for inclusion on StashDB.
