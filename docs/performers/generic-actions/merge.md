# Merging Performers

Guidelines unique to merging two or more performers together are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For performer guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Merge Targets

!!! abstract ""

    Typically, click "Merge" on the entry with the performer name you'd like to keep.

When merging, click the blue "Merge" button on the performer entry you would like to keep. This will be the "merge target." Best practice is to use the entry with the preferred primary name as your merge target when possible. In other words, please refrain from merging and renaming if one of the merged performer entries already has the preferred name. This may require merging an entry with more information into an entry with less, so be sure to include any potentially lost information in your merge submission.

## Set Performance Aliases

!!! abstract ""

    Usually leave box checked unless the merged name is identical to the merge target's name.

When merging performers, there is a checkbox that says, "Set performance aliases to old name." The performance alias is used to show what name the studio used for that performer on that particular scene at the time of release. When this box is checked, all scenes without a performance alias will fill this field with the pre-merge performer name. Typically, the box should only be unchecked (it's enabled by default) when a merged name is exactly the same as the merge target's name. We don't want StashDB to say "Jane Doe (credited as Jane Doe)" for example. This will sometimes require separating merges into two submissions: one with the box checked and one with it unchecked.
