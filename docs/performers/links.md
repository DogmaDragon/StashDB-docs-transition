# Performer Links

Guidelines relating to URLs attached to a performer's profile are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For performer guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Personal Links

{: .important }
**Links to personal accounts of performers not associated to their professional career are disallowed.**

Links to a performer's personal accounts are disallowed unless they are explicitly tied to a professional account. The distinction of a personal account is one that has no association with their pornographic profession and may include personal details including but not limited to their real name. Links to escort service accounts, e.g., SexyJobs, is prohibited unless the performer has linked to them from their pronographic performer account.
