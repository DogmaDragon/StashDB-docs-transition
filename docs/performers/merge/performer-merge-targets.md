# Performer Merge Targets

{: .important }
**Typically, click "Merge" on the entry with the performer name you'd like to keep.**

---

When merging, click the blue "Merge" button on the performer entry you would like to keep. This will be the "merge target." Best practice is to use the entry with the preferred primary name as your merge target when possible. In other words, please refrain from merging and renaming if one of the merged performer entries already has the preferred name. This may require merging an entry with more information into an entry with less, so be sure to include any potentially lost information in your merge submission.
