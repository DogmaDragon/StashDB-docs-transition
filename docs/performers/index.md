# Performer Guidelines

Performer guidelines are sorted into various groups and sub-sections to help editors find all guidelines relating to a particular subject. These categories can be found in two different places, both presented in roughly the same order as they appear within StashDB.

As long as you remain within the **Performer Guidelines** section of the website, all of these sections will be listed in the sidebar on the left-hand side for quick navigation.

Alternatively, these same categories can be found in the tabbed lists below. The first tab covers guidelines unique to creating, merging, and destroying performers, while the others emulate the tabs within StashDB's edit forms.

    - [Create](generic-actions/create)

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

These guidelines are a constant work-in-progress and primarily maintained by admins with many other responsibilities, so some sections may be incomplete, outdated, or empty. If you want to help us improve our documentation, please see [this guide](LINKZ) for more information.
