# Performer Aliases

Guidelines relating to a performer's aliases are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For performer guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Eligible Aliases

{: .important }
**Must be an official adult credit, no legal names allowed except when a stage name is also their given name.**

Performer aliases must be names that have been used as official credits in an adult video performance. They do not have to be names used as performance aliases in a scene already listed on StashDB. This means that outside of the rare occasion of someone regularly using their given name in adult performances instead of a separate stage name...

{: .warning }
**Legal names and birth names are not allowed anywhere on StashDB**.

Other names that **cannot** be used as aliases unless they've also been used as an official adult credit:

1. Professional credits from non-adult mainstream performances
2. Professional credits or bylines as a writer or author
3. Display names or usernames from non-adult public social media accounts
4. Names used in news articles about a performer

Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval.

## Suspicious Aliases

{: .important }
**Exercise caution with odd looking aliases, particularly those listed on FreeOnes.**

Not all names and aliases listed on external sources are appropriate on StashDB. Names must have been used as an official adult credit somewhere to be eligible as a primary name or alias on StashDB. This disallows legal names in almost all instances. Please see [Eligible Aliases]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-aliases/eligible-aliases/) for more details on alias requirements.

Users should be cautious when sourcing names and aliases from FreeOnes in particular. Because FreeOnes disallows single name performers, some contributors bypass the limitation by fabricating longer names for single name performers. These usually consist of two single name aliases merged into one. For example, a performer with the aliases `Lucy` and `Jane` could become `Lucy Jane` on FreeOnes. Since these names are not used anywhere else, they should not be included on StashDB.

FreeOnes will often list suspected legal names of performers as well. They are not always accurate and they are not always used publicly by the performer. These names are usually very different from the performer's other listed aliases and from typical adult performer names in general, especially when they include middle names. Other sources will sometimes list suspected legal names as well, but they will often label them as "birthnames" or "real names."

Be skeptical of any name that isn't listed anywhere else, especially if it's a combination of other aliases or if it doesn't seem like a typical adult stage name.
