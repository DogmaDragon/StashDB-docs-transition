# Performer Name

Guidelines relating to a performer's primary name are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For performer guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Preferred Names

!!! abstract ""

    Prefer unique names over commonly used aliases, but otherwise no hard rules only suggestions.

!!! warning ""

    Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval.

There are no hard guidelines for choosing primary performer names at this time. However, more unique aliases are almost always preferred over common single word names like "Lola" or "Tony". If you must use a single name, make sure you add a [Disambiguation]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/disambiguation/).

The following should also be taken into consideration: most frequently used alias, most famous/popular alias, most commonly used name on other databases like IAFD, and alias currently/recently preferred by the performer (often determined by social media profiles).

Also be aware that names are only eligible to be primary names if they've been used as an official adult credit, following the same requirements as [Eligible Aliases]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-aliases/eligible-aliases/).

## JAV Names

!!! abstract ""

    **Western order with simplified Latin characters as default primary name, all other spellings as aliases.**

JAV performers often have their names ordered in three different ways: Western order (GivenName FamilyName) with Latin characters, Japanese order (FamilyName GivenName) with Latin characters, and Japanese order with Japanese characters. Different sources will prefer different spellings. For StashDB, we prefer the Western order with Latin characters for all JAV performers as the primary name, matching the formatting of our non-JAV performers. This also makes things simpler for crossover performers who have worked in both Western and JAV productions. Names in the reverse order should always be included as aliases.

To give an example, we use the name [Marica Hase](https://stashdb.org/performers/d4f1a54f-ddc7-4f50-a356-d417802cab1c){:target="_blank"} on StashDB. She has done many Western scenes after starting on the JAV side of things, but her primary name is the same regardless of whether she's considered a JAV performer or a Western performer: `Marica Hase`. Alternate spellings `Hase Marica` and `はせまりか` are included as aliases. All three are the same name, just spelled three different ways following three different formats.

The same [guidelines for picking a primary name]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-name/preferred-names/) apply equally to JAV and Western performers. However, JAV performers may also have the same name spelled in various ways following various different conventions for using Latin characters. Typically, StashDB prefers the use of a simplified Hepburn romanization for primary names which avoids the use of double vowels like `oo` or `uu` as well as diacritic marks like `ō` or `ū`. This is also the same spelling preferred by [X/s List](https://xslist.org/en){:target="_blank"} which is one of the only remaining JAV databases in English. However, an exception may be allowed on a case-by-case basis if a particular romanization for their name that does not follow this convention is the most commonly used or is known to be the performer's preferred spelling. Again, these are the [same guidelines]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-name/preferred-names/) for choosing alternate spellings of Western performer names and they still apply here as well. But due to the difficulty for non-Japanese speakers to determine this for all but the most popular Japanese performers, using the simplified Hepburn spelling as the default should cover most JAV performers without requiring additional research.

As another example, we prefer the spelling of [Yu Shinoda](https://stashdb.org/performers/8465400a-eb3c-4c3f-a78f-09d7541cf27d){:target="_blank"} as the primary name instead of `Yuu Shinoda` or `Yū Shinoda`. If we were creating this performer for the first time, this would be a safe first assumption because it avoids using double vowels or diacritic marks and matches the spelling used on [X\s List](https://xslist.org/en/model/13.html){:target="_blank"}. If we really wanted to dig deeper (which isn't required for an initial creation and is only possible because she's a popular performer), we'd find different romaji spellings used on [Minnano-AV](http://www.minnano-av.com/actress504478.html){:target="_blank"}, [IMDB](https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6193437/){:target="_blank"}, [Wikidata](https://www.wikidata.org/wiki/Q11603788){:target="_blank"}, and even her own [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/yuu_shinoda){:target="_blank"}. But since [her agency](http://www.t-powers.co.jp/official/talent/%e7%af%a0%e7%94%b0%e3%82%86%e3%81%86/){:target="_blank"}, [Twitter](https://twitter.com/yu_shinoda){:target="_blank"}, [IAFD](https://www.iafd.com/person.rme/perfid=yushinoda/gender=f/yu-shinoda.htm){:target="_blank"}, [FreeOnes](https://www.freeones.com/yu-shinoda){:target="_blank"}, and [Babepedia](https://www.babepedia.com/babe/Yu_Shinoda){:target="_blank"} all use `Yu Shinoda`, that remains the preferred option because it appears to be her own preferred romanization as well as the most commonly used spelling for English language databases. All other spellings that can be found should be used as aliases instead.

## Suspicious Names

!!! abstract ""

    **Exercise caution with odd looking names, particularly those listed on FreeOnes.**

Not all names and aliases listed on external sources are appropriate on StashDB. Names must have been used as an official adult credit somewhere to be eligible as a primary name or alias on StashDB. This disallows legal names in almost all instances. Please see [Eligible Aliases]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-aliases/eligible-aliases/) for more details on alias requirements.

Users should be cautious when sourcing names and aliases from FreeOnes in particular. Because FreeOnes disallows single name performers, some contributors bypass the limitation by fabricating longer names for single name performers. These usually consist of two single name aliases merged into one. For example, a performer with the aliases `Lucy` and `Jane` could become `Lucy Jane` on FreeOnes. Since these names are not used anywhere else, they should not be included on StashDB.

FreeOnes will often list suspected legal names of performers as well. They are not always accurate and they are not always used publicly by the performer. These names are usually very different from the performer's other listed aliases and from typical adult performer names in general, especially when they include middle names. Other sources will sometimes list suspected legal names as well, but they will often label them as "birthnames" or "real names."

Be skeptical of any name that isn't listed anywhere else, especially if it's a combination of other aliases or if it doesn't seem like a typical adult stage name.

## Diacritics

!!! abstract ""

    **Diacritics are allowed in the primary name but the name without diacritics must be included as an alias.**

Diacritics are the marks added above or below a letter to indicate a difference in pronunciation. Two common examples are the acute ( ◌́ ) and the grave ( ◌̀ ). The primary name of a performer may include any of these diacritical marks but the same name without any diacritics will need to be included as an alias. This makes it easier to find them in search results. For example, [Vitória Vonteese](https://stashdb.org/performers/fbd10ce7-3209-4788-b84f-3a2ec1b19326){:target="_blank"} has a diacritic in her primary name but also has `Vitoria Vonteese` (no diacritic) as an alias.

Also, please be aware that the same considerations explained in [Preferred Names]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/name/preferred-names/) still apply here. A name without diacritical marks may still be preferrable as the primary if it's by far the most commonly used spelling for that performer, for example.

[JAV Names]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-name/jav-names/) are a notable exception to all of the above. Please see that page for more details.
