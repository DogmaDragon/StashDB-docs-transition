# Performer Disambiguation

Guidelines relating to how performer is differentiated from others with the same name are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For performer guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Disambiguating Single Names

{: .important }
**Performers with a single word as their primary name require disambiguation.**

While we try to keep primary names unique, sometimes a single word name like `Jane` or `John` is unavoidable. Maybe they're best known as the single name, or maybe they've only ever used that single name. (Please see [Preferred Names]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/performer-name/preferred-names/) for guidance on choosing a performer's primary name.) Regardless, single-name performers must be disambiguated to avoid confusion. This is true even if there are no other performers currently known to share that name on StashDB or elsewhere. For guidance on choosing a disambiguation, please see [Disambiguation Formatting]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/performers/edit/disambiguation/disambiguation-formatting/).

If you are adding a disambiguation to an existing single-name performer on StashDB, please make sure that the profile is not an ambiguous catch-all entry representing multiple performers. Each performer must be split out into their own profiles as necessary before a disambiguation may be added. Please see [Ambiguous Performers]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/performers/ambiguous-performers/) for more details.

## Disambiguation Formatting

{: .important }
**No standardized format, but a combination of career dates and some unique characteristic should work for most performers.**

While there is no standardized format at this time, most disambiguations share the same approach: a combination of career span and some unique characteristic. Remember, disambiguations are used to differentiate between performers that share the same name so make sure that your chosen characteristic uniquely identifies this performer compared to others who share their name. For example, `2008-2010, UK` if there's a difference in nationality or `BangBros, 2017` if they're exclusive to a particular network or studio. The exact order of `Years, Characteristic` vs. `Characteristic, Years` does not matter at this time.

Also, please note that there are no parentheses or brackets in the examples above. You only need to enter `1998-1999, Blonde` into the disambiguation field and it will be displayed as `Jane Doe (1998-1999, Blonde)` throughout StashDB. We want it to be as brief and clean as possible and do not want it to become `Jane Doe ((1998-1999, Blonde))`.
