# Assigning Tag Categories

{: .important }
**If the tag you're editing doesn't have a category yet, add one yourself even if you have to guess to mark it as "sorted".**

---

If the tag you're editing doesn't have a category yet, try to assign one in the same edit. This shows that somebody has handled a tag, [marking it as "sorted"]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/tags/sorted-vs-unsorted-tags/) to some extent. Categories are easy to correct afterwards, so don't worry about guessing. Also feel free to ask in the **#ministry-of-truth** channel on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-discord-and-matrix/) for clarification.
