# Capitalizing Names

{: .important }
**Title casing for words and phrases, all-caps with no punctuation for acronyms.**

---

Tag names and aliases should follow [proper title-casing](https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/AP/){:target="_blank"} for individual words and phrases. This means most words will only have the first letter capitalized but small words in the middle of a phrase (prepositions, conjunctions, articles, etc.) should be left completely lower case. For example, `Missing or Removed` would be correct. `Missing Or Removed`, `missing or removed`, and `MISSING OR REMOVED` would be incorrect.

However, every letter should be capitalized for acronyms. There should also be no punctuation between each letter. For example, `BDSM` would be correct. `Bdsm`, `bdsm`, and `B.D.S.M.` would be incorrect.
