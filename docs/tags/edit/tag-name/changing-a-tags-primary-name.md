# Changing a Tag's Primary Name

{: .important }
**Prioritize brevity, clarity, familiarity, and consistency.**

---

Since users can rename a tag to anything they'd like from within Stash, a tag's primary name isn't too important. Many will come down to purely subjective personal preference. Because of this, we don't have to worry about Stash too much when (re)naming tags. The main consideration when picking a primary name is how it will be displayed and organized on StashDB itself. Specifically, we want to find a balance between brevity, clarity, and familiarity, as well as its consistency with the naming of other tags. If you feel like a different name would be preferable for a particular tag, be sure to [check its edit history]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/tags/read-tag-edit-histories/) first to see if it's been considered before or why it's using the current primary name.
