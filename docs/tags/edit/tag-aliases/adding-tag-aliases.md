# Adding Tag Aliases

{: .important }
**Make sure there aren't any other tags that would be a better fit for an alias, or that another tag isn't using it already.**

Tag aliases on StashDB have limited usefulness at the moment. They do not have the same functionality as Stash's tag aliases. However, we are still trying to use them in anticipation of future updates to both Stash and Stash-Box. Aliases can be used as alternative primary names, reflections of previously merged tags, terms used by a studio not covered by current aliases, alternate spellings, common misspellings, etc. The only limit for tag aliases other than basic relevancy is the following: Are there other tags using this term as its primary name? Are there other tags using this term as an alias? Are there any tags where this term would better fit as an alias? Would this alias be better suited as its own tag?
