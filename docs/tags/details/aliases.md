# Tag Aliases

Guidelines relating to a tag's aliases are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For tag guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Adding Tag Aliases

{: .important }
**Make sure there aren't any other tags that would be a better fit for an alias, or that another tag isn't using it already.**

Tag aliases on StashDB have limited usefulness at the moment. They do not have the same functionality as Stash's tag aliases. However, we are still trying to use them in anticipation of future updates to both Stash and Stash-Box. Aliases can be used as alternative primary names, reflections of previously merged tags, terms used by a studio not covered by current aliases, alternate spellings, common misspellings, etc. The only limit for tag aliases other than basic relevancy is the following: Are there other tags using this term as its primary name? Are there other tags using this term as an alias? Are there any tags where this term would better fit as an alias? Would this alias be better suited as its own tag?

## Capitalizing Aliases

{: .important }
**Title casing for words and phrases, all-caps with no punctuation for acronyms.**

Tag names and aliases should follow [proper title-casing](https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/AP/){:target="_blank"} for individual words and phrases. This means most words will only have the first letter capitalized but small words in the middle of a phrase (prepositions, conjunctions, articles, etc.) should be left completely lower case. For example, `Missing or Removed` would be correct. `Missing Or Removed`, `missing or removed`, and `MISSING OR REMOVED` would be incorrect.

However, every letter should be capitalized for acronyms. There should also be no punctuation between each letter. For example, `BDSM` would be correct. `Bdsm`, `bdsm`, and `B.D.S.M.` would be incorrect.
