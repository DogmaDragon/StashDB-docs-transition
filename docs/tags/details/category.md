# Tag Category

Guidelines relating to a tag's category are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For tag guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Assigning Tag Categories

{: .important }
**If the tag you're editing doesn't have a category yet, add one yourself even if you have to guess to mark it as "sorted".**

If the tag you're editing doesn't have a category yet, try to assign one in the same edit. This shows that somebody has handled a tag, [marking it as "sorted"]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/tags/sorted-vs-unsorted-tags/) to some extent. Categories are easy to correct afterwards, so don't worry about guessing. Also feel free to ask in the **#ministry-of-truth** channel on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-discord-and-matrix/) for clarification.
