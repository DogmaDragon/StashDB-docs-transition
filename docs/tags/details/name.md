# Tag Name

Guidelines relating to a tag's primary name are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For tag guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Changing a Tag's Primary Name

{: .important }
**Prioritize brevity, clarity, familiarity, and consistency.**

Since users can rename a tag to anything they'd like from within Stash, a tag's primary name isn't too important. Many will come down to purely subjective personal preference. Because of this, we don't have to worry about Stash too much when (re)naming tags. The main consideration when picking a primary name is how it will be displayed and organized on StashDB itself. Specifically, we want to find a balance between brevity, clarity, and familiarity, as well as its consistency with the naming of other tags. If you feel like a different name would be preferable for a particular tag, be sure to [check its edit history]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/tags/read-tag-edit-histories/) first to see if it's been considered before or why it's using the current primary name.

## Capitalizing Names

{: .important }
**Title casing for words and phrases, all-caps with no punctuation for acronyms.**

Tag names and aliases should follow [proper title-casing](https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/AP/){:target="_blank"} for individual words and phrases. This means most words will only have the first letter capitalized but small words in the middle of a phrase (prepositions, conjunctions, articles, etc.) should be left completely lower case. For example, `Missing or Removed` would be correct. `Missing Or Removed`, `missing or removed`, and `MISSING OR REMOVED` would be incorrect.

However, every letter should be capitalized for acronyms. There should also be no punctuation between each letter. For example, `BDSM` would be correct. `Bdsm`, `bdsm`, and `B.D.S.M.` would be incorrect.
