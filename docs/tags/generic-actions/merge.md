# Merging Tags

Guidelines unique to merging two or more tags together are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For performer guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Tag Merge Targets

{: .important }
**Click "Merge" on the page of the tag you want to keep, then select any tags that should be removed and merged.**

If you click the big blue "Merge" button at the top of a tag's details page, that tag becomes the target of your merge request. In other words, any additional tags selected in the edit request form will be absorbed into that initial tag. Always merge into the tag you intend to keep. Often it will be the only "sorted" tag in your merge with a category and/or definition assigned to it. If you are merging previously "unsorted" tags, your preferred merge target is usually the most frequently used variation (meaning, it has the most scenes attached). Also please note roughly how many scene entries a tag has in your [edit comment]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/tags/tag-edit-comments/) before merging. There is no easy way to find these numbers after a merge and they are often taken in consideration when choosing [primary names]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/tags/edit/tag-name/changing-a-tags-primary-name/). If you would prefer to change the primary name of the tag as well, it is best to save that for a separate edit after the merge is approved.

## Merging Sorted Tags

{: .important }
**"Sorted" tags (already has category/description) shouldn't be considered eligible to be deleted or merged. Ask on Discord first if you think you've found an exception.**

If a tag has already been assigned a description, then it has already been organized by another editor. These can be considered ["sorted" tags]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/tags/sorted-vs-unsorted-tags/). It could be used as a merge target, but shouldn't be considered eligible to be deleted or merged into something else at this time. If you feel you've found an exception to this, please ask in the **#ministry-of-truth** channel on [Discord]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/stashdb/joining-discord-and-matrix/) first.

{: .note }
Unconfirmed guideline, subject to change pending formal approval.
