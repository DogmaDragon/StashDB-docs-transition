# Destroying Tags

Guidelines unique to the removal of an existing tag are listed below, roughly sorted by importance. Individual guidelines are also listed in the right-hand sidebar for quick navigation.

For tag guidelines covering different subjects, please see the sidebar to the left.

---

Each guideline starts with a blue callout box styled like this:

!!! abstract ""

    A single sentence containing a brief explanation.

These short statements represent the official guideline itself. Changes to the language within the blue box require an [official approval process](LINKZ) for all confirmed guidelines.

The write-ups below each blue box contain more detailed explanations of the guideline. They provide guidance on how to interpret, apply, and enforce the guideline. These are all approved (and usually written) by StashDB admins, but changes do not require an official approval process. The language here may be modified at any time to improve clarity or reflect changes in the codebase, shared consensus, moderation practices, etc.

[Unconfirmed guidelines](LINKZ) will be marked with their own yellow callout box. While not officially approved, they reflect a well-established consensus and editors are still expected to follow and enforce them.

## Destroying Tags

{: .important }
**Rarely appropriate, usually there's a potential merge that would be preferred.**

Great care must be taken when deleting tags. When tags are destroyed, it is not easily reversed. Even if a tag seems irrelevant or useless, be sure to use the [search bar](https://stashdb.org/tags){:target="_blank"} to look for similar tags first. If you find a lot of similar tags or if those tags represent a large number of scenes, then it may be better to merge than to delete. Merging is always preferred over deleting, and [many of the same considerations apply]({{ site.baseurl }}/docs/faq_getting-started/tags/merging-and-destroying-tags/). Easy candidates for deletion include performer/director names, but make sure these are also saved in the proper fields of all the scenes themselves before submitting your destroy request. Sometimes series titles are used as tags. These can also be easy deletions, but it can sometimes be better to merge it into a similar tag. In these situations, the series title probably doesn't need to be added as an alias.
