# Duplicate Tags

{: .important }
**Search StashDB for similar terms, check tag descriptions and aliases to avoid overlap.**

---

Tags that are considered too similar to existing tags on StashDB will be rejected. Be sure to search [StashDB's tag list](https://stashdb.org/tags){:target="_blank"} for similar terms and check tag descriptions to see how they compare to the intended usage of your new tag. Some crossover between tags is allowed, but tags require helpful distinctions between them. Also make sure your new tag's primary name and any aliases you've attached to it are not already used by another tag as an alias. Conflicting aliases will cause your submission to fail, even if it is approved by the voters. StashDB's [tag search](https://stashdb.org/tags){:target="_blank"} considers aliases, so they shouldn't be too hard to spot.
